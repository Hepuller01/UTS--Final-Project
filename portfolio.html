            <h2>Task 1 Self-Reflection Essay</h2>
            <textarea placeholder="Write your content here...">
                During my high school years, I struggled with how I saw myself. I was very shy and quiet, often choosing to sit by the window or near the door to avoid being in the middle of the group. I felt safer observing others from a distance rather than joining in. I didn’t believe I had much to offer in conversations or group activities. My self-esteem was low, and I felt that I wasn’t as interesting or confident as other students. I thought my quiet nature made me less valuable, which made it hard for me to get involved in social situations.
        
                One of the biggest challenges I faced was asking for help. Whether it was in class or when I needed support, I found it hard to speak up. I was afraid people would judge me or think I was weak for needing help. I often kept my questions or concerns to myself, even when I could have benefited from asking. I would spend a lot of time overthinking simple things like how to respond to a message, unsure if what I said would be good enough. My lack of trust in myself made it hard for me to reach out to others for assistance, and I often second-guessed even the smallest interactions.
        
                The social and cultural pressures at school made things harder for me. In high school, it seemed like everyone was expected to be outgoing and social. Many of my classmates were confident and could easily make friends or speak up in class. I felt like I didn’t belong or couldn’t keep up with their energy. This made me feel isolated, as though there was something wrong with me for being shy. The culture around me pushed me to be more social, and I often compared myself to others, thinking I wasn’t good enough because I wasn’t like them.
        
                When I started college, things slowly began to change. I realized that being quiet didn’t mean I wasn’t good enough. I began to step out of my comfort zone, trying to talk to new people and take part in group activities. At first, it was difficult, but each time I tried, I felt a little more confident. I learned that people weren’t judging me as harshly as I had thought. I made some new friends, and over time, I started feeling better about myself. I also realized that I didn’t need to be like everyone else. I could still be myself and be valued, even if I wasn’t the loudest person in the room.
        
                Even though I still sometimes struggle with self-doubt, I’ve learned a lot about myself. I now understand that my self-esteem can grow over time. I’ve learned that asking for help is okay, and making mistakes is part of learning. Personal growth is about being true to who I am, while also pushing myself to try new things. While I still face challenges, I’m now more willing to take chances and trust myself to handle them. My journey has shown me that growth takes time, but it’s worth it when I keep moving forward.

                        Joining the Rover Scouts and climbing a mountain for the first time helped me grow in different ways. 
                        According to Erikson's theory, stepping into new roles allowed me to explore who I am beyond my past experiences. 
                        The mountain climb pushed me toward self-actualization, as it challenged my limits and built my confidence. 
                        Interacting with different grade levels taught me important social skills, as I observed and learned from others, following Bandura's Social Learning Theory.
                        Overall, these experiences helped me understand myself better.

                        Christmas Eve gatherings help me grow because they give me chances to connect with my family and learn more about myself. 
                        According to Erikson's theory, spending time with my relatives strengthens my sense of belonging and helps me build relationships, which is important for shaping my identity. 
                        Vygotsky's theory shows me how these family traditions, like sharing meals and playing games, shape my understanding of culture and influence my thinking. 
                        Through Bandura's theory, I learn by observing my relatives' behavior, which helps me understand different roles and how to act in social situations. 
                        Piaget's theory explains how these events also help me manage my emotions and think about how I feel in different moments. As I interact with my family, 
                        I become more aware of who I am and how I relate to others. These experiences make me better at communicating, empathizing, and adapting in different social situations. 
                        Overall, Christmas Eve helps me grow emotionally, socially, and culturally, giving me a deeper understanding of myself.

                        In this experience, I can relate to Albert Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory. 
                        At first, I had very low self-confidence and didn't believe in my ability to succeed in the pageant. 
                        However, the support I received from my family, teachers, and classmates helped boost my confidence through social persuasion. 
                        According to Bandura, seeing others believe in me made me start believing in myself.
                        As I continued despite my fears, I gained personal mastery experiences, which helped me build a stronger belief in my abilities. 
                        Over time, this process allowed me to overcome my doubts and feel more confident in who I was.

                        When I joined the School Press in Grade 12, it was a big step for me because I had doubts about my abilities after stopping in high school. According to Carl Rogers' Self-Concept Theory, I had a negative self-concept at the time, believing I wasn’t capable. However, a classmate recommended me, and despite my hesitation, I decided to take the risk, reflecting the idea of self-actualization,
                        where I pushed beyond my comfort zone to realize my potential. Before the results came out, I deleted my Facebook and Messenger to avoid seeing any negative feedback, which showed my fear of disappointment, aligning with the concept of self-protection. When I woke up and saw a message telling me I made it, it boosted my self-efficacy (a belief in my ability to succeed), which is part of Albert Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory.
                        Making it to the top 7 and eventually winning third place proved to me that I was capable of more than I thought. This experience taught me that personal growth often comes from stepping outside your comfort zone and taking risks, even when you're unsure of the outcome.

                        Now that I’ve graduated to Grade 12, I’ve been reflecting on how far I’ve come in understanding who I am. 
                        Erik Erikson’s theory of Identity vs. Role Confusion really fits my experience over the past few years. 
                        My mom has always been there for me, offering support and encouragement that helped me believe in myself, even during tough times. 
                        My friends have shown me different perspectives, helping me explore what I truly value and want in life. 
                        Teachers played a big role, too, pushing me to exceed my limits and boosting my confidence in my abilities. 
                        Thanks to all their guidance, I feel like I’ve gained a better sense of who I am and what I want to become. 
                        It’s been a journey of self-discovery, and although I still have much to learn, I feel ready for the next chapter.

                        When my friends came over to celebrate my birthday, even though we couldn't hang out earlier, it really made me feel good about myself. 
                        Erik Erikson's theory talks about a stage called "Identity vs. Role Confusion," where we try to figure out who we are, and I think this moment was a big part of that for me. 
                        Having my friends take the time to come over showed me that I matter to them, and that felt really special. 
                        It made me feel more confident in who I am, knowing I have people around me who care. It was a reminder that I’m not alone, and my friendships are something I can count on. This experience really helped me understand myself better and my place in my friend group.

                        My 18th birthday was simple,a family lunch and blowing out a cake at night but it felt special because I was with the people I love. 
                        It showed me that I value meaningful moments over fancy celebrations. 
                        Growing up, I sometimes felt pressured by the idea that big parties are important, but my family helped me see what truly matters. 
                        I struggled with comparing myself to others, but I learned to focus on my own happiness. 
                        It made me more confident and helped me understand myself better.

                        We won the dance competition because our class worked together as a team. 
                        This picture shows the moment we succeeded, reminding me how everyone helped and supported each other. 
                        We shared ideas, practiced hard, and encouraged one another to do our best. 
                        I felt proud knowing that our teamwork brought out the best in each of us. 
                        From Charles Cooley’s “Looking-Glass Self” theory, I learned that people’s praise and recognition boosted my confidence and self-esteem.
                         The “Social Identity Theory” also helped me understand how being part of a team shaped my sense of belonging and identity. 
                         This experience taught me the importance of unity, trust, and cooperation in achieving goals. 
                         It reminded me that success is sweeter when it is shared with others.

                        When I was re-elected as class president in Grade 8, I smiled and said yes, but deep inside, I was scared and unsure. 
                        I didn’t have the courage to say no, afraid of disappointing my teacher and classmates. 
                        That moment left a mark on me, as I kept questioning if I was truly enough for the role or just pretending to be capable. 
                        My self-esteem dropped every time I remembered it, and I felt trapped between others' expectations and my own doubts. 
                        The cultural pressure to respect authority and put others first only made it harder for me to speak up for myself.
                        But as I reflect on that experience, I’ve learned that it’s okay to speak up for myself and set boundaries.
                        It’s not about pleasing everyone—it’s about being true to who I am and trusting my own voice.

                        College life taught me how to commute and travel alone because, in elementary and high school, my school was just a short walking distance from home.
                        Learning to commute helped me become more independent and confident in handling new situations. 
                        In college, I also met new friends who made me realize the importance of building connections and communicating with others. 
                        Before, especially in high school, I rarely talked to people, but now I see how socializing can help me grow. 
                        Using Erik Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, I learned that forming relationships during this stage helps shape my identity. 
                        Charles Cooley’s “Looking-Glass Self” theory also showed me how interacting with others helped me understand myself better through their feedback. 
                        These experiences taught me independence, communication, and the value of connecting with others.

                <p>As a first-year computer science student, I have a strong passion for technology and programming, but I am just starting to build my skills. 
                My goal is to become a software developer in the next five years and successfully graduate from college. 
                To reach this, I will focus on improving my academic performance, learning outside the classroom, and gaining real-world experience. 
                First, I will prioritize my studies by attending all my classes and completing my assignments. 
                Understanding core topics like programming, algorithms, and data structures will be important for building a strong foundation for my future career.</p>
                <p>Beyond my coursework, I will also take advantage of free online resources like Codecademy, Coursera, and YouTube to expand my knowledge. 
                These platforms offer free courses on programming languages and tools, which will help me stay updated with industry trends and technologies. 
                This will allow me to deepen my understanding and learn at my own pace. 
                Additionally, I plan to work on personal coding projects and contribute to open-source projects. 
                These hands-on experiences will help me practice my skills, build a portfolio, and gain confidence in applying what I’ve learned to real-world problems.</p>
                <p>Finally, I will seek internships or part-time jobs to gain hands-on experience in the field. 
                Even unpaid positions will provide valuable insights into the software development process and help me build my resume. 
                I will also attend coding meetups and join online communities to network with professionals in the field. 
                This will allow me to learn more from others, ask questions, and gain advice that will guide my career path. 
                By following this plan, I believe I can successfully graduate with a computer science degree, build the necessary skills, and secure a junior software developer position within the next five years.</p>

               <p>Improving my physical fitness is an important goal for me, especially since I feel that my BMI doesn't align with my ideal health. 
                As a college student living in a boarding house, I don’t have the time or resources to cook my meals, but I still want to achieve a healthier BMI and build better physical habits. 
                I plan to focus on free or low-cost exercises, such as bodyweight workouts at home, running, or walking outdoors. I can also use fitness apps like Training Club or follow YouTube workout videos to stay active. 
                These activities don't require any equipment and will help me improve my strength and endurance.</p> 
                <p>Since I can’t cook my meals, I will focus on finding healthier food options within my budget. 
                I will look for affordable, nutritious meals at nearby food stalls or stores, choosing healthier choices like salads, grilled meat, or simple dishes with vegetables and rice. 
                I can also prepare easy-to-carry snacks like fruits, yogurt, or nuts, which will help me avoid unhealthy fast food. This way, I can make better food choices without spending too much money.</p>
                <p>Achieving physical fitness will also help me in my career goal of becoming a software developer. 
                Staying fit can improve my mental clarity, focus, and energy levels that are crucial for programming. 
                Being active will help me stay alert and productive during long study sessions or coding work. 
                Physical fitness can also reduce stress, which will help me stay motivated and handle challenges in both my academic life and my future career. 
                By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I can perform my best in both school and in becoming a successful software developer</p>

                    This artwork shows me standing in the corner, wearing a blue top and yellow skirt, holding a puzzle piece in my hand while looking at a wall with an unfinished puzzle. 
                    The incomplete puzzle on the wall represents my journey of self-discovery. It shows that I am still growing and learning, and there are still parts of myself I need to figure out.
The puzzle piece in my hand shows that I’m open to new opportunities and willing to keep growing. It reminds me that there’s always more to discover and improve about myself. 
The blue top represents calmness and clarity, while the yellow skirt represents energy and optimism. Together, they reflect my desire to learn and bring all parts of myself together.
This artwork reminds me that I need to put in time and effort to grow and become the best version of myself. It also shows that I should be open to changes and new opportunities and remember that it’s okay to ask for help from others when needed. Growth is a journey, and we all need support along the way.
On the other hand, the corner where I stand is a place to reflect, it reminds me that I shouldn’t always stay in the corner. We need to step out, connect with others, and try new things to grow fully. Just like a puzzle needs all its pieces to be complete, I need to connect with the world around me to become the best version of myself.
